First release of **IBM i & z/OS Explorer** by Gaurav Gupta.

### z/OS (z/OSMF REST)
- **Data sets:**
    - filters, PDS/PDSE members;
    - open, edit and save back to the host, with a warning if someone else changed the member since you opened it (ETag check);
    - allocate PDS/PDSE/PS from presets, create and delete members and data sets, recall migrated data sets, upload local files.
- **USS:** browse, open, edit, save, create files and directories, delete, upload.
- **Jobs:**
    - owner/prefix filters, colour-coded status and return codes;
    - open spool files one by one or all at once, cancel, purge.
- **Submit JCL** from the editor (`Ctrl+Alt+S`) or from a member, with an option to wait for the job and show its output.
- **TSO** and **MVS console** commands, with history.

### IBM i (SSH + SQL)
- **Libraries:** library filters picked from a list; each library shows its source files, members and objects.
- **Source members:** open, edit and save; create source files and members; delete members.
- **Compile** (`Ctrl+E`): configurable commands per source type; with `OPTION(*EVENTF)`, errors appear in the Problems panel.
- **CL commands** with history.
- **SQL** from a prompt or a `.sql` editor (`Ctrl+R`): results in a sortable, filterable grid with CSV export.
- **IFS:** browse, edit, create, delete.
- **Spooled files**, **active jobs** with job logs, **end job**.
- **PASE shell:** an interactive SSH terminal inside VS Code.
- **Sign-in:** the connection wizard asks **Password** (kept in the OS keychain) or **SSH private key file** (picked with a file dialog).

### General
- Syntax highlighting for JCL, COBOL, RPGLE and CL.
- Every request sent to the host is logged in the *IBM i & z/OS* output channel; passwords are never logged.
- Debug setup:
    - `.vscode/launch.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json`;
    - `start-debug.bat` (Windows, one click);
    - source maps and a rebuild-on-save mode (`npm run watch`).
- GitHub Actions workflow that builds the `.vsix` and publishes a GitHub Release when a `v*` tag is pushed.
